# MATLAB Simulations for Batch, CSTR, and PFR Reactors

## Project Overview
This repository contains MATLAB simulations for modeling and optimizing three types of chemical reactors:
- **Batch Reactor**
- **Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR)**
- **Plug Flow Reactor (PFR)**

The project focuses on first-order chemical reactions, utilizing numerical solvers to model reaction kinetics, solve governing equations, and optimize reactor design parameters.

## Features
- Simulation of **reaction kinetics** for first-order reactions.
- **Differential equation solving** using MATLAB solvers (e.g., `ode45`).
- **Design parameter optimization** for enhanced reactor efficiency.
- **Concentration profiles** for batch and plug flow reactors.

## Project Structure
- **`Batch_Reactor.m`**: MATLAB script for simulating a batch reactor.
- **`CSTR.m`**: MATLAB script for simulating a CSTR.
- **`PFR.m`**: MATLAB script for simulating a plug flow reactor.
- **`Results/`**: Contains plots and simulation outputs.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
